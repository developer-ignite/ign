/**
 * MyIGNITE — CampusGroups Event Image Sync
 *
 * Problem this solves:
 * Events imported from the ReadyEducation CampusGroups ICS feed (via The
 * Events Calendar's Event Aggregator) never carry an image, because ICS
 * feeds have no image field. CampusGroups DOES put the original event
 * page URL into the imported event's "Event Website" field. That public
 * event page has an <meta property="og:image"> tag IF an image was
 * uploaded when the event was created on CampusGroups — and has no such
 * tag at all if it wasn't. This script:
 *
 *   1. Finds events that have a Website URL but no featured image yet.
 *   2. Fetches that CampusGroups page.
 *   3. Looks for og:image. If absent, skips the event — this is expected
 *      and not an error (CampusGroups organizer just didn't upload one).
 *   4. If present, downloads the image and sets it as the event's
 *      WordPress featured image (which is what The Events Calendar uses
 *      for event listing/single-event images).
 *
 * Runs two ways:
 *   - On a schedule, hourly, via WP-Cron (paired with WP Engine's
 *     "Alternate cron" toggle in the User Portal, so this isn't dependent
 *     on live site traffic to fire on time).
 *   - On demand, manually, via WP-CLI:  wp myignite sync-images
 *     (Useful for testing without waiting for the hourly run.)
 *
 * Logs every run to: wp-content/myignite-image-sync.log
 * Each line is timestamped and says exactly what happened to each event
 * (updated / skipped-no-og-image / skipped-already-has-image /
 * skipped-no-website / error-with-reason) so that anyone debugging this
 * later — including someone with zero prior context on this script —
 * can read the log and understand exactly what the script saw and did,
 * without needing to read the code first.
 *
 * Where this file lives:
 *   wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME/inc/helpers/myignite-image-sync.php
 *   required from the theme's functions.php — see the one-line snippet
 *   in the comment at the very bottom of this file.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Renames CampusGroups club_acronym tags from concatenated uppercase
 * (e.g. IGNITEEVENTS) to a readable form (e.g. IGNITE Events) on import.
 *
 * Why this is needed:
 * CampusGroups exports a CATEGORIES line with X-CG-CATEGORY=club_acronym
 * containing the club acronym as a single concatenated uppercase string
 * with no spaces. Event Aggregator imports this verbatim as a WordPress
 * tag, producing unreadable tags like IGNITEEVENTS, IGNITEADVOCACY, etc.
 *
 * The other two CATEGORIES lines CampusGroups exports per event are:
 *   X-CG-CATEGORY=event_type  e.g. "Social Event", "Orientation"
 *   X-CG-CATEGORY=event_tags  e.g. "Campus - North", "Campus - Downtown"
 * These are already human-readable and are left completely alone.
 *
 * TO ADD A NEW FEED IN FUTURE:
 * If a new CampusGroups club feed is added and its club_acronym value
 * isn't in $acronym_map below, it will import as-is (no breakage, no
 * errors) — it'll just appear as the raw acronym string. To find the
 * exact acronym for a new feed, run this WP-CLI command:
 *
 *   wp eval '
 *   $body = wp_remote_retrieve_body(wp_remote_get("YOUR_ICS_URL_HERE"));
 *   $lines = explode("\n", $body);
 *   foreach($lines as $line) {
 *     if(strpos($line, "club_acronym") !== false) echo $line . "\n";
 *   }'
 *
 * Then add a new entry to $acronym_map below and redeploy.
 *
 * Confirmed acronyms from live feeds as of July 2026:
 *   IGNITEEVENTS   — ical_club_35455.ics
 *   IGNITEADVOCACY — ical_club_35458.ics
 * The remaining three feeds (governance, services, promotions) had no
 * events at time of writing — acronyms below are assumed from the naming
 * pattern and should be verified when those feeds become active.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// ICS IMPORT: STOP AUTO-CREATING/LINKING VENUE + ORGANIZER POSTS
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Why this is needed:
 * Event Aggregator's ICS import auto-creates a `tribe_venue` and/or
 * `tribe_organizer` post for every distinct venue/organizer name it sees,
 * and links the event to them. CampusGroups' feed always sends the same
 * one or two organizer names and a small set of venue names, so every
 * import run was slowly accumulating archive-page posts nobody asked for.
 * We want the venue/organizer name to survive as plain text on the event,
 * with no linked post and no archive page created at all.
 *
 * Where TEC actually creates these posts (confirmed against the installed
 * plugin, TEC 6.16.5):
 *   wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/Tribe/Aggregator/Record/Abstract.php
 *   Venue post created ~line 1839, Organizer post created ~line 2023 —
 *   BOTH happen *before* the `tribe_aggregator_before_save_event` /
 *   `before_update_event` / `before_insert_event` filters (lines 2089,
 *   2104, 2140). Hooking any of those three is too late — by then the
 *   Venue/Organizer posts already exist in the database. The only point
 *   that runs early enough is `tribe_aggregator_translate_service_data`,
 *   applied in Tribe__Events__Aggregator__Event::translate_service_data()
 *   (src/Tribe/Aggregator/Event.php:208) — this fires immediately after
 *   the raw item is translated into the `$event` array and BEFORE
 *   Abstract.php's venue/organizer creation blocks even check for data
 *   to act on. Emptying `$event['Venue']` / `$event['Organizer']` there
 *   means those blocks never run at all: no matching, no creation, no
 *   linking.
 *
 * That filter only receives ($event, $item) — no origin/record info — so
 * we pair it with `tribe_aggregator_before_insert_posts`, which fires once
 * per import batch (Abstract.php ~line 1541, before its loop starts) and
 * does receive $meta['origin']. We use it to flag "this batch is an ICS
 * import" for the duration of that batch.
 *
 * Confirmed data shapes for ICS items (Event.php:67-207):
 *   $item->venue->venue        — venue name, single object.
 *   $item->organizer           — either a single stdClass or an array of
 *                                 them (one per organizer); each has
 *                                 ->organizer as the name.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — the real origin string is 'ical', not 'ics':
 * Event Aggregator has two distinct origins that both read .ics-format
 * calendar data:
 *   - 'ics'  → Tribe__Events__Aggregator__Record__ICS (uploading a local
 *              .ics FILE — a one-off, not what CampusGroups uses).
 *   - 'ical' → Tribe__Events__Aggregator__Record__iCal (polling a live
 *              .ics URL on a recurring schedule).
 * The CampusGroups feeds on this site (e.g. .../ical_club_35455.ics,
 * scheduled daily) are 'ical' origin, confirmed directly from an existing
 * import record's postmeta (_tribe_aggregator_origin = ical) and its
 * activity log (which shows a Venue and Organizer post actually being
 * created on a real run). Both origins are handled below, since either

/**
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SETUP — one-time steps, not code to run automatically:
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. Save this file as:
 *    wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME/inc/helpers/myignite-image-sync.php
 *
 * 2. In your theme's functions.php, add this single line:
 *
 *    require_once 'inc/helpers/myignite-image-sync.php';
 *
 * 3. In the WP Engine User Portal, enable "Alternate cron" for this
 *    environment (Sites → [your install] → [environment] → Utilities →
 *    Advanced → Alternate cron toggle). This makes the hourly schedule
 *    registered above actually fire on time, instead of depending on
 *    someone visiting the site.
 *
 * 4. Test manually before waiting for the schedule. SSH in via WP
 *    Engine's SSH Gateway, navigate to the site, run:
 *
 *      wp myignite sync-images
 *
 *    Then check wp-content/myignite-image-sync.log to see exactly what
 *    happened, and check a real event in wp-admin to visually confirm
 *    the featured image actually landed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WIPE AND REIMPORT PROCEDURE (if resetting all event data):
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. Deploy this file with all changes FIRST, before wiping anything.
 * 2. Delete all existing events, venues, organizers, and tags via WP-CLI:
 *
 *      wp post delete $(wp post list --post_type=tribe_events --format=ids) --force
 *      wp post delete $(wp post list --post_type=tribe_venue --format=ids) --force
 *      wp post delete $(wp post list --post_type=tribe_organizer --format=ids) --force
 *      wp term delete $(wp term list post_tag --format=ids) --by=id
 *
 * 3. Manually trigger each Event Aggregator import from:
 *    wp-admin → Events → Import → [each feed] → Import Now
 * 4. Run the image sync immediately rather than waiting for the schedule:
 *      wp myignite sync-images
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
